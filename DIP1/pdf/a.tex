\paragraph{Theory}
\paragraph{1.} What is a digital image? \\ \\
A digital image is a machine-readable representation of a photograph. The parts (pixel) of the image are represented in structures like matrices, graphs or trees. Every pixel describes a color in a discrete color space.
\paragraph{2.} What does the paradigm $\glqq$bottom-up processing$\grqq$ mean? \\ \\
Bottom-up processing is a paradigm of image-processing, where you try to recognize objects in an image and state a hypothesis of it's meaning based on these objects. The opposite of bottom-up processing is top-down processing. There you start with a model, which you try to match with the image.
\paragraph{3.} State at least three fundamentally different image sources? \\ \\ % group 1 and 2 as electromagnetic waves?
\begin{itemize}
\item visible light
\item infrared
\item radio waves
\item sound waves
\end{itemize}
